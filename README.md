Description: The dataset used in this project was gathered from credit card transactions. It comprised several numerical features that represented different transaction characteristics. To ensure privacy, these features were anonymized and transformed into variables labeled V1 to V28. The dataset also contained a binary target variable, 'Class,' which indicated whether a transaction was fraudulent (Class = 1) or legitimate (Class = 0).

**METHODS:**
The integration of data loading, pre-processing, cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation offered a holistic approach to address the issue of fraud detection in credit card transactions.
